                            <h2>Character Overview</h2>
                            <p>The Unbidden Housemate is a mythological human species that resembles humans but behaves more like a predator or wild creature. They share most of our structure and proportions, but several major traits set them apart. They are noticeably larger than regular humans, and their bone density is much higher, making them stronger and more durable. Their skin can range from unusual tones to rough textures that help them survive harsh environments. Their endurance is extreme compared to humans. They can run for long periods without tiring and tolerate conditions that would normally injure us. Their teeth are their most disturbing feature. They are built for tearing and crushing hard materials such as bone, bark, and even certain rocks. They treat these materials as if they are nothing.</p><p>Older stories refer to them as the Shadowborn Species of Humans or the "Azodrius". Some people claim that they descended from a group of colossal humans who either split from humanity thousands of years ago or existed before humans even appeared. They lived in isolated territories for so long that their bodies and instincts changed. When they eventually crossed paths with people again, conflict started immediately. They hunted humans in different ways. Some hunted because they needed food (eating humans). Others hunted because it stimulated them or gave them a sense of dominance. Over time, these encounters created fear and warnings passed from generation to generation.</p><p>There are known races among them based on their environments. The desert race has heat-resistant skin and arid features that help them survive sand and sun. The forest race adapts to shaded areas with skin tones and stealthier behavior (Almost similar to humans). The snowy race is larger and pale with thick skin to survive freezing temperatures. These are the only confirmed groups, but no one knows if more exist. Some researchers believe there may be mountain races, swamp races, or even</p><p>cave-adapted ones, but no one has survived long enough to confirm these theories.</p><p>The character belongs to the forest race. This race is known for a manipulative and harmful personality. They tend to use distraction, mimicry, and psychological pressure when hunting. Their skin is usually gray-green mixed with a light beige tone, helping them blend into tree bark, moss, soil, and shadows. Their skin texture is rough like old wood or dry clay. Their eyes have a sharp green-lime color that reflects light much stronger than human eyes, allowing them to see well in the dark.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>About the character:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The Unbidden Housemate lives alone in the forest. She was isolated from her tribe after displaying behavior that the tribe considered unacceptable (Sexual Seducing behavior toward the wild human males in the tribe). Her aggressive behavior and her promiscuous actions conflicted with their survival rules and social expectations. Because of this, she was expelled and left without support. This isolation forced her to act independently. She had to learn to hunt alone, hide alone, and survive without her race’s help.</p>
                            <p>She eventually discovered the neighborhood where Julian lives (Julian is the main character for the real story behind the encounter with the unbidden housemate). She approaches it for simple reasons. She is searching for steady food sources, abandoned places where she can sleep, and a hidden area where she can hibernate safely. She has no intention of harming anyone at first. However, her instincts change fast when she feels threatened or discovered. If someone sees her, especially at close range, she reacts with fear, aggression, or the urge to silence that person. This reaction is part instinct and part trauma from being rejected by her own kind.</p>
                            <p>She watches from a distance at first. She studies how humans behave, how the neighborhood moves at night, where people place trash, which houses are dark, and which paths are quiet. Her curiosity mixes with hunger and caution. She does not fully understand human social rules, and she keeps a primal mindset. She does not care about human privacy or property. She only cares about survival, safety, and avoiding capture.</p>

                            <h2>Original Story</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(0, 255, 128) !important;">The discoverer's name: Julian Gladwell <span style="text-align: center;"><br>(32-year-old male, British Nationality)</span></p>
                            <p>Julian Gladwell lived in an isolated neighbourhood deep inside a thick forest where only a few houses were scattered between the trees. People liked the area for its clean air and quiet surroundings, and Julian enjoyed the routine of living far from noise. He worked as a shopkeeper in a big supermarket in town, usually returning home late in the evening. His cabin was simple and old but comfortable, and he kept a twelve-gauge shotgun in his bedroom closet, mostly because everyone in the area did the same for safety.</p>
                            <p>His life was ordinary. Nothing strange ever happened until a few weeks ago. It started small. Some nights, Julian heard heavy footsteps downstairs. They were slow, spaced apart, and heavier than anything he had ever heard inside the house. They sounded like someone large was moving from the basement stairs to the kitchen. The sound lasted only for a few seconds before going silent. Every time Julian heard them, he froze in bed, wondering if the house was settling or if an animal had sneaked in. The idea of an intruder crossed his mind, but he always told himself he was overthinking. He worked long hours and came home tired. His mind played tricks sometimes.</p>
                            <p>Then the missing food started.</p>
                            <p>One morning, he opened the fridge and found that some of his leftovers were gone. A sealed container was half empty, even though he clearly remembered finishing only a small part of it the night before. The water in his large metal cauldron always seemed lower than when he left it. At first, he blamed himself, thinking he had eaten without remembering or maybe had spilled something. But the pattern repeated the next day, then the next week. Small bites are missing, pieces of fruit are taken, and water is disappearing faster than usual.</p>
                            <p>There was no broken window, no damaged door, nothing that suggested someone had broken in. So Julian ignored it, but the feeling built slowly inside him that he was not alone in the house.</p>
                            <p>A faint, strange smell filled the rooms around the same time. It was sharp and earthy, almost metallic, like wet dirt mixed with something old. It came from the lower floor, near the basement door. Julian thought maybe an animal had died under the house or something damp was rotting down there. He checked the main floor and the attic but found nothing.</p>
                            <p>The more the days passed, the more the sounds increased, especially at night. Footsteps became more frequent. Small creaks turned into heavier, deliberate movements. He sat in bed some nights gripping his phone, listening to the floorboards groaning under the weight that was not his own.</p>
                            <p>One late evening after work, Julian noticed the bulkhead door outside was slightly open. That door led straight into the basement. He never used it, and he was certain he kept it closed. He stared at it for a long time before shutting it firmly and heading into the cabin. He tried not to think about it and went to bed. The next morning, more food was missing. The smell was stronger.</p>
                            <p>By the third day, Julian decided he had to check the basement. He did not want to do it, but the idea of someone living down there became too real to ignore. He took his flashlight and a pocket knife, even though he felt stupid doing it. But he needed answers.</p>
                            <p>He searched the house from top to bottom first. The attic was empty. His bedroom was normal. Every closet was checked twice. He then stood at the top of the basement stairs, took a deep breath, and went down.</p>
                            <p>The smell hit him immediately. It was stronger than ever and felt humid and warm, as if the air itself was being exhaled by something living. He reached the basement floor and lifted the flashlight. The beam cut through the darkness and landed on something in the far corner. There was a figure standing there.</p>
                            <p>A female shape, but nothing about her resembled a normal human. She was tall, much taller than him, and wide, as if her bones were thicker and her limbs were built for strength he had never seen. Her skin looked rough and uneven, almost animal-like. Her hair was long but tangled and wild. She had a powerful, unnatural posture, slightly hunched yet towering.</p>
                            <p>What froze him in place were her eyes. They were wide open, unblinking, and locked on him the moment he appeared. She stood perfectly still. No breathing sound, no movement, no shifting. Just staring.</p>
                            <p>Julian felt his entire body turn cold. For a second, he could not move at all. Then panic hit him so fast that he nearly dropped the flashlight. He turned and ran up the stairs with all the strength he had. His legs felt weak and shaky. His mind convinced him he was hallucinating, or maybe dreaming. Anything was better than accepting what he had just seen.</p>
                            <p>He burst upstairs away from the basement towards his bedroom, grabbed his twelve-gauge shotgun from the closet, and stood there shaking. He waited for the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs, but nothing happened. The house stayed silent.</p>
                            <p>After minutes that felt like hours, he forced himself to move again. He checked every room with the shotgun raised, sweeping corners and shadows. He went downstairs and into the basement again. She was gone...With no trace...Nothing was disturbed. No footprints. No movement. She had vanished silently, even though her size should have made her impossible to overlook. That made it worse.</p>
                            <p>Julian could not sleep at all. He locked the bulkhead door and installed two new metal locks on it the next morning. He reinforced the door from the inside until it looked almost ridiculous. His neighbours noticed and asked why he was suddenly securing everything. He brushed them off, saying he was just making sure nothing bad happened. He avoided any explanation because he knew how insane it would sound.</p>
                            <p>After that night, Julian lived with a quiet fear that never left him. He understood now that the creature had been living in his house for who knows how long. Eating his food. Drinking his water. Moving around while he slept. Living a hidden life in his own basement without him ever knowing.</p>
                            <p>She was wild. She was intelligent enough to avoid detection. And she was big enough to kill him with ease if she ever wanted to.</p>
                            <p>The idea that she might return at any moment stayed with him every time he walked down the hall or opened a door. He did not know what she was, and he never found out.</p>
                            <p>But the memory of her eyes staring at him from the darkness stayed forever, reminding him that something massive and silent had once lived right under his feet.</p>
