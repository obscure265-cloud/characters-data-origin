                            <h2>Character Overview</h2>
                            <p>The Abandoned Experiment HT_05 (Human transformation the fifth)” refers to an experimental, laboratory-engineered creature originally designed as a military project meant to enhance soldiers’ strength and endurance in close-quarters combat. HT_05 was once Emilia Peterson, a 23-year-old Mexican American woman who lived an ordinary life. She struggled with family issues, eventually living on her own, spending time with friends, and working as a cashier in a small coffee shop.</p>
                            <p>The man responsible for her transformation was V. Anatoly (Vladimir Anatoly Zakhaev). He kidnapped Emilia in order to continue his experimental work after several of his previous attempts had failed for various reasons. Anatoly was once a top-ranking employee at M.R.I.S., participating in major classified projects such as the Wild Human Project and the HTE-Experiment.</p>
                            <p>Years earlier, the human transformation experiment was conducted inside M.R.I.S. facilities, but it ended catastrophically. This event, known as Incident 922 in the year 2000, produced deformed, morphic humanoid creatures with zombie-like behavior. They attacked anything they saw, yet their bites or injuries did not infect victims because the creatures were biological constructs, not virus-based organisms.</p>
                            <p>Anatoly had warned the organization about a critical hormonal flaw that would destabilize the subjects’ minds and bodies, but no one listened. As a result, many workers were killed during the outbreak. After the incident, Anatoly abandoned M.R.I.S. and became a wanted fugitive for violating protocols and escaping with forbidden knowledge.</p>
                            <p>He retreated into an isolated forest and established a secret laboratory above an old World War II bunker. He built a concealed cabin connected to the underground structure, installing equipment and rebuilding his research in complete secrecy while M.R.I.S. continued to hunt for him.</p>
                            <p>HT_05 turned out drastically different from the original HTE subjects. While she shared minor similarities such as altered skin and impaired sight, her development was far more stable. Her body grew naturally instead of deforming. Unlike the HTE-general subjects, whose limbs expanded with grotesque fleshy tumors, HT_05 remained structurally intact. She was the only successful result after HT_01 through HT_04 had failed.</p>
                            <p>Her growth was remarkable. Originally 1.92 meters tall as a human, her height gradually increased to 2.92 meters over several years. However, she still suffered from a critical flaw: severe visual impairment. Her blindness made her incomplete in Anatoly's eyes, despite her otherwise stable transformation.</p>

                            <h2>Original Story</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(0, 255, 128) !important;">The discoverer's name: Jordan Robertson<span style="text-align: center;"><br>(27-year-old male, Australian Nationality)</span></p>
                            <p>Jordan Robertson never called himself an explorer, but he liked checking out abandoned places whenever he had time off work. He was not famous, and he never posted anything online. It was just a private hobby that kept him occupied. One day, he decided to visit a forest that people in his area kept talking about. Locals claimed it was haunted or full of strange activity. Jordan did not believe any of that, and the only thing that pushed him to go was proving to himself that it was just another quiet place.</p>
                            <p>He parked his truck at the tree line and walked in with a small backpack, flashlight, and a notebook where he usually wrote about the places he found. The deeper he walked, the more isolated the forest became. There were no trails, no signs of visitors, nothing that looked like a camping spot. After almost an hour of walking, he found a small wooden cabin hidden between the trees. It looked old but not abandoned for decades. The structure was still strong, and the lock on the door was undone.</p>
                            <p>Jordan stepped onto the porch and knocked, but no one answered. The door was slightly open, and he pushed it with the back of his hand. Inside, he saw simple furniture and jars of powders he could not identify. The place was dusty but not destroyed. It looked like someone had lived here and left in a hurry.</p>
                            <p>While walking around, he noticed the floor under a rug felt hollow. He moved the carpet aside and found a trapdoor. He hesitated at first, but curiosity won. He opened it and climbed down an iron ladder into a narrow hallway. A sharp chemical smell hung in the air as if the place had been used recently. When he reached the end of the hallway, he entered what looked like a forgotten lab built inside an old bunker. There were papers everywhere, medical tools, empty syringes, and labels with names like (MSVGS, GH, PTDS 007 and PTDS 009), and sort of empty ampoules like this.</p>
                            <p>He checked the papers on the desk. Many mentioned experiments numbered HT 01 through HT 04. All of them were marked as failures. One file focused on HT 05, the only one listed as still active. It included the name Emilia Peterson and another signature, V Anatoly or USER 972, in rushed handwriting. The notes made little sense. Some lines were written as if the writer was in a panic. Nothing he read felt normal, and he realized he had walked into something that was never meant to be found.</p>
                            <p>While he was reading, he heard a low sound from a metal door that blended into the wall so well that he had not noticed it earlier. He froze and waited. The sound came again, like something knocking from the other side. He tried to convince himself it was a pipe or an animal, but something about it felt wrong. Despite every instinct telling him not to do it, he approached the door and forced it open.</p>
                            <p>The room inside was dark and cold. He shone his flashlight around until it reached the far corner. At first, he thought he was looking at a body, but then it moved. It was a humanoid female creature, larger than any normal person. Her limbs were chained in multiple places, and her body showed scars and wounds. Her head slowly turned toward him, and her eyes were empty, white, staring without blinking.</p>
                            <p>The moment she looked at him, Jordan felt something he had never felt before. It was not fear in the usual way. It was the kind that hits so hard that his body locks up for a few seconds. He backed away from the door and ran without looking behind him. He climbed the ladder fast enough that he scraped his arm on a metal latch, but he did not stop. He left the cabin, sprinted through the forest, got into his truck, and drove straight back to the city.</p>
                            <p>He reported everything to the police as soon as he reached home. The officers questioned him again and again. He tried to explain what he saw, but his words kept breaking apart. After a while, they sent a team to investigate. Jordan never heard what they found. He only knew that after giving his statement, he went back home and stayed inside for days.</p>
                            <p>A few months passed ,and nothing happened until one morning when someone knocked on his door. Four tall men in suits and sunglasses stepped inside without waiting for permission. Their voices were calm and cold. The first thing they asked was if he was a YouTuber. He told them no. They asked if he posted his explorations online or if he had any kind of following. Again, he said no. They studied him as if they were trying to decide whether he was telling the truth.</p>
                            <p>One of them finally said, Do not tell anyone about what you saw, Jordan. We want you to keep it that way. After that, they left his house and did not look back.</p>
                            <p>Several months later, Jordan returned to the forest out of curiosity. He wanted to see if the cabin was still there. When he reached the area, he was shocked. The forest entrance was blocked, and warning signs were everywhere. Guards stood behind fences, and he saw military style vehicles parked in the distance. They did not look like anything used by regular forces. When he drove past slowly, he realized the cabin was gone. The entire area had been replaced by some kind of restricted zone.</p>
                            <p>He did not get out of his truck. He did not ask questions. He just turned around and drove home. He spent the entire drive thinking about how close he had gotten to something people like him were never supposed to see. He understood that whatever was kept inside that bunker was not abandoned by accident.</p>
                            <p>And he understood that the creature he found was never meant to be discovered at all.</p>
